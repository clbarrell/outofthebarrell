My name is Chris Barrell and my story is about learning things of one domain to take them to another.

I've done a few things so far - from org psych consulting, customer success, people science to product management.

My favourite so far is **product management**. It leverages my two key strengths; my tech knowledge, so I know what people are talking about and my customer empathy, so I can easily embody the customer and their point of view. I work at Culture Amp as a product manager in Melbourne.

## Currently

I have two focuses at the moment;

* Cementing Culture Amp as the undisputed leader of culture benchmarks in our industry, via. becoming a better product manager
* Shipping and selling [ourmemories.io](https://www.ourmemories.io) to work out if it's something that is viable or whether I should kill it off.
