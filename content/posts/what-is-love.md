## What is the most important question?

The most important question is one that will release my mind. This weekend I've been preoccupied; with the down jacket that I was obsessed with buying. As well as the overhanging stress of the product management aspects of my job.

Why am I stressed? Probs not the most important question. I know the answer. It's because of the ambiguity on the path forward.

What is the simplest path through the forest of reactivity that results in fucking awesome benchmarks? :rocket: This is the good question - because if I can answer that, I won't be stressed; I can move onto the next phase of progress.

:smile:

> What do I want to get out of ourmemories? ⭐

This is a good question because I think it is holding me back from shipping. I want ourmemories to be a practice ground for me - it has been - but also a demonstrable outcome of progress. I want to get 5 other startups using it.

I haven't published it yet, because each time I consider it I think of reasons why it would fail after being publish. E.g., "what's the point in publishing it if people sign up but then don't find feature X?". This has merits - there's no point in pushing something shit. But the question then becomes "Is this good enough for V1?", but what is good enough?

What is the good enough story? I have 2 levels of stories; 
- For Mary, her team aren't just coworkers. They're friends that she enjoys hanging out with. Like friends that have a lot of history together, before they know it, in jokes and sharing old memories create the sense of bonding. A team that bonds together works well together. (Higher performing?). Leading up to the holidays, Mary wants to remind the team of some of their recent exploits by finding that awesome picture she took when they celebrated when they hit 1000 customers. But we all know searching through photos in Slack sucks 💩! When Mary adds @ourmemories to her team's Slack, Mary finds the photo she's looking for in minutes. Emily shares it back to their team's Slack channel where the whole team starts adding crazy reactions and starts commenting in a thread that soon adds up to more than 100 replies! As the team heads off on holidays, Mary feels much happier having kindled the joy the team has for each other.
	- (is the team sad? Is this helping Mary who's the team lead, elevate the morale?)
	- Outcome: Mary's job as a team lead is now easier because she can throw in emotive old team photos into her posts and doesn't have to rely on outstanding speeches.[^1]

[^1]: My very important footnote.

- Sharon is a HR manager at a fast-growing, distributed start up. Sharon wants to find ways to help all her staff cultivate empathy and interest in everyone else in the company. Easier said than done of course, especially when you've got people all over the world! Sharon comes across ourmemories when searing for 'Culture add' Slack apps. Sharon adds @ourmemories to the Slack channels for the different offices they have. As ourmemories starts collecting all the photos shared by people from around the world load, the best ones start to get a lot of reactions, comments.. Sharon is then able to remind everyone of all the awesome things going around the world by highlighting the best photos each month in a shared channel called "all_photos". By showing the most reacted to photos, people can see how exciting things are even though they may not be subscribed to the source channels. At the end of the day, Sharon now has one less hassle as ourmemories automatically takes care of cultivating morale and joy for her business.
	- Outcome: Sharon rests more comfortably, knowing that there is now a tool/process automatically reinforcing the culture that Sharon has so carefully cultivated.

**Which of these stories is most engaging? How can you compare them? Maybe you can come the customer outcome / impact?**

> Why won't I ship ourmemories? 

Because I'm worried that it won't work. And I have to do it all before launching so that I can offset any and all risks. Maybe I have to change what I expect to happen? Or accept what's within my control. OR Plan a more resilient path forward.

**Resilient path forward.** How can I 'publish' ourmemories to reddit, indie hackers and even message some other people that use Slack, with current functionality and make it "successful". Success for an initial push would require them to use ourmemories to cultivate the culture they've created. That could be for a team (sharing a photo) or for the biz using the global shared photos channel, giving everyone oversight of awesomeness.

Declare the desired outcome of my launch on customers. Then, will my product meet that? If yes, I'm happy to ship! Then every other achieved outcome is just a side bonus 😃.

> When will there not be another feature to make?

When the desired outcome is defined and it is anticipated to be met.
